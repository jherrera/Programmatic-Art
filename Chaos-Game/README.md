# Chaos Game

The *chaos game* is a mathematical game used to produce fractals. It works as follows

    - Draw vertices (usually 3) V1, V2 and V3
    - Pick a random point P
    - Select a random vertex 
    - Draw a point halfway between selected random vertex and P
    - Consider the newly drawn point as the new P and repeat the process

In the sketch, you can click on any empty black area to add vertices to the game, or you can drag around the white dots to move the vertices around. Moving any of the vertices resets the animation.
